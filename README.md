## Favorate Papers

- Intrinsic Motivation and Automatic Curricula via Asymmetric Self-Play, 2018, "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05407.pdf"

    > This paper and ["go-explore"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10995) represent one direction for reward-sparse environment exploration: create curriculum task ("near-goal" to "far-from-goal") for RL training. The curriculum is controlled by a clever teacher-student technology.

- Neural Lyapunov Control, 2019, "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/2647c1dba23bc0e0f9cdf75339e120d2-Paper.pdf"

    > One of the earliest works on deep learning for Lyapunov functions. By introducing neural network as a fexible function families for Lyapunov functions, it provides strong tools of stability certificate for non-linear systems.
